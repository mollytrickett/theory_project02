- Implemented a breadth-first Turing Machine simulator that reads machine specifications from CSV files and simulates the machine's behavior on given input strings.
-  The simulator uses a tree structure to explore all possible non-deterministic paths, tracking parent-child relationships between configurations.
- Uses the a+ machine (accepts strings of one or more 'a's) with comprehensive test cases to demonstrated correct acceptance/rejection behavior, proper state tracking, and appropriate handling of invalid inputs and limits.
